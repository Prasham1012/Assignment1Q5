# Assignment1Q5
The first question of the estimation task

the code moves thus:

putting in the initial conditions from the given questions and initialising the arrays resectively
finding phi and tau matrices for the analytical solution
discretisation and comparison a. analytical solution b. RungeKutta method c. matlab func ode45 solution
the plots have the three elements of the position vector plotted with time
the file func1.m contains the diff equation as well as the input function


For running:
Run main_task1 directly to obtain phi and tau values
Run rk4.m, ide45taskA.m, and analytical.m by themselves to obtain plots
the initial condition, array initialization, and function codes can be found separately in the file but need not be run run seprately to implement the codes above
time step and duration can be altered in the initialization code
